# Code Wars 10 - Map to to Double the Values - 4/23/2018

**Author**: Jennifer Bach
**Version**: 1.0.0

## Overview
<!-- Make the double() function return a new array with each value twice as large as the corresponding value in the passed in array. Your solution must use the map() function of the built-in javascript Array object. If you're not familiar with map(), reading over the documentation may help.

function double(array) {
    // Use array.map() to return a new array with each value twice
    // as large as the corresponding value in the passed in array.
}

For example:
var someNumbers = [1,2,10,57];

double(someNumbers); // should return [2,4,20,114] -->

## Change Log
